## Invetigating Adaptive Epistasis using *Dmel* RILs

This is a collaborative project involving genotyping and phenotyping of two sets of *Drosophila melanogaster* RILs. One set consists of a France *vs* Zambia (France RILs) cross and the other an Ethiopia *vs* Zambia (Ethiopia RILs) cross. For each set, two phenotypes have been measured. For the France RILs, the phenotypes were ethanol tolerance and cold tolerance. For the Ethiopia RILs, the phenotypes were wing length and pigmentation. The pigmentation phenotype is further subdivided into three distinct measures: pigmentation score in gray scale for the background of the mesopleura (a thorax trait), and two abdominal traits, a pigmentation score the 4th abdominal segment (A4 Background), and the proportion of the 4th abdominal background covered by a black stripe.

The genomes for each RIL and the parental strains were obtained with Next Gen sequencing using Illumina platform.
